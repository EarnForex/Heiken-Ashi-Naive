# Heiken Ashi Naive

**Warning! This expert advisor can lose all your money! Test it on demo! Apply on live account at your own risk only!**

Heiken Ashi Naive is a custom MT4/MT5 expert advisor coded by EarnForex.com. It uses a rather naive approach to Heiken Ashi trading and reverses the classic strategy - it buys when the Heiken Ashi candles are very bullish and sells when they are very bearish.

The EA showed some moderate long-term profit on EUR/USD @ D1 backtests.

A Z-Score-optimized version of the trading robot is also available. It attempts to apply Z-Score optimization to the trading process. Make sure you understand what you are doing before using the Z-Score version.
